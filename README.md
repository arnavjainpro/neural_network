# Neural Network

This repository contains a simple implementation of a three-layer neural network. Each layer of the network consists of nodes, with each node having its corresponding weight.

## Structure

The neural network is structured with the following layers:

- **Input Layer:** The first layer where data is fed into the network.
- **Hidden Layer:** The middle layer which processes the data by applying weights and activation functions.
- **Output Layer:** The final layer that provides the prediction or classification based on the processed data.

### Visualization

Below is a basic visualization of the three-layer neural network structure:

## Features

- Three-layer architecture.
- Ability to adjust weights and biases.
- Implements forward and backward propagation for training.
- Supports various activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, etc.).

## Getting Started

To use this neural network:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arnavjainpro/neural_network.git
   cd neural_network
